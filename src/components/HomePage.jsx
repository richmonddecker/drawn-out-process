          Welcome,
          <span style={{color: "orange"}}> friend</span>!
          This website is an open-source technical artistic project by
          <span style={{color: "orange"}}> Justin Richmond-Decker</span>. 
          The goal is to provide you with an immersive and captivating visual experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site features both interactive and passive content elements,
          <span style={{color: "orange"}}> called PODs</span>
          , and gives you a high degree of control to curate and customize your own session.
          Here
          <span style={{color: "orange"}}> you are encouraged to play around with the configurations</span>,
          to see what interesting effects you can achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are using a phone or tablet,
          <span style={{color: "orange"}}> please view this site with the screen turned sideways</span>.
          The sidebars will cause problems if the display is not wide enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please also note that
          <span style={{color: "orange"}}> this site may produce flashing effects and rapidly changing visuals</span>,
          which may cause certain individuals to experience astonishment and mesmerization.
          Go ahead and use the side bars to get started.
