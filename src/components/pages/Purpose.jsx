      Why did I make this site? For fun, for personal development, to have a fulfilling personal project that can
      bring joy to myself and others. Also, to explore and enhance my design abilities, and showcase my work. This
      site in a way is a portfolio of mine, not just for web development, but also for graphics and visual art.

      What is it for? Well, a big goal of this website is to have it be enjoyed by as many people as possible. This
      website is designed to be enjoyed on a computer or portable device. But, it is also designed with a different kind
      of experience in mind. The content of this website is also meant to be projected on walls in public or party spaces.
      This can encourage group fun and participation.

      Drawn Out Process can also be run in a slideshow mode, automatically switching through different visuals.
      This is perfect for projecting or putting on a screen, for people to look at. They can either stare fixatedly, or glance
      over every once in a while, based on their mood. Put music on too, if you want. It's up to you!

      I use a portable projector to display this content at festivals and other such events.
      <span style={{color: "orange"}}> I encourage anyone and everyone to use or share the content of this website however they like. </span>
      Being credited is always nice. :)
