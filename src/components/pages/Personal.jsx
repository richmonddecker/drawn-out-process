    <p>
      I am a software engineer, traveler, amateur musician, friend to many, and enemy to few. I love visual art,
      but never found a talent for it. When I realized I could combine this love with my programming abilities,
      I was excited to explore this new passion of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2014-2017, I worked as a software engineer at the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia.
      I spent most of 2018 traveling, until I suffered a serious ankle injury. During this time, I picked up the
      laptop again and started coding, until I ended up with the idea for this site.
    </p>

      Besides this and the guitar, my biggest hobby is language learning. Although only reasonably fluent in the first two,
      I can speak Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Hebrew. I have found that my knowledge of foreign languages has
      greatly enhanced my traveling experience and allowed me to form friendships I couldn't have otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm glad you're here and I really hope you enjoy this site. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, ideas, or comments.
